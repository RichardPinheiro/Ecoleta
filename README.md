## üíª About the project

‚ôªÔ∏è Ecoleta - is a way to connect companies and entities that collect organic and inorganic waste to people who need to dispose of their waste in an ecological way.

Companies or entities may register on the web platform by sending:

- in addition to selecting one or more collection items:
   - lamps
   - Batteries
   - papers and cardboard
   - electronic waste
   - organic waste
   - kitchen oil

Users will have access to the mobile application, where they can:

- contact the entity via E-mail or WhatsApp
